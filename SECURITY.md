# Reporting Security Issues

The LTV Co. team takes security issues in our projects seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose any vulnerabilities, and we are committed to acknowledging your contributions and resolving issues promptly.

If you discover a potential security issue in `@ltvco/form-validation`, please report it by emailing [security@ltvco.com](mailto:security@ltvco.com) and include the phrase **"Security Report â€“ form-validation"** in the subject line.

We will make every effort to respond quickly and keep you informed throughout the investigation and resolution process.

Please do not report security vulnerabilities through GitHub issues or pull requests, as this could expose the issue publicly before it is resolved.
